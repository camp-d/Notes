hierarchical design methodology involves creating segments of a product
that are designed with different tools at differeing levels of specificity. 

synthesizer cad tool takes specification/hardware description language
and creates design from the specification. 

Lab portion of the class involves using synthesizer on HDL code. 

schematic capture (drawing schematics) becomes untenable with larger and 
more complex designs

during process of synthesis, technology mapping involves putting specific hardware into design.

-EDIF: Electronic Design interchange format. 

-Functional Simulation is final step that verifies design. 
    functional simulators assume the time needed for signals to propagate through the logic gates
    is nebligible. 

    timing simulators must be used in tandem with functional simulators in order
    to obtain a complete test of the design. 


    add timing bounds to portions of circuit: best, worst, typical
    this allows for testing with all possible operation timings. 

    Use spice for specific timing measurements/edge cases. Spice uses
    numerical methods and has higher precision than simple digital logic simulators

    
    Event-driven simulation:

        -Zero delay simulators will not detect race and hazard conditions.
        -Race condition: when two or more signals are changis simultaneously in 
            a circuit which may resuelt in an ein correct state when a condition is assumed to be stable.


        Possible states in logic simulation:
        -0
        -1
        -U (unknown) 
        -Z (high impedance) Relevant with TSB (tri-state buffer) and TG (transmission gate)

        use reset or preset signal to set unknown back into a known state.
