= Formal Grammar
- Formal grammar describes how to form valid strings in a language from an alphabet of symbols.



= Chapter 4 minic and parsing

- Parsing is done recursively via recursive descent.
- recusrion can be right recursive or left recursive.





- Derivation tree
    - takes some program source as input, parsing while applying grammar.
    - forms tree that represents symbols in program and program structure.
    - parser will incrementally build tree, then reduce, and repeat
